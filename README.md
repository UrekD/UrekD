👨‍💻 Formerly managed servers and developed for [TF15/2BNB](https://discord.gg/FA7EJkq2zU) milsim group. Still enjoy dabbling in development 😊 Created [Workshop Monitor](https://github.com/UrekD/Steam-Workshop-Monitor) to streamline server updates; there might even be an instance running on my homelab!
