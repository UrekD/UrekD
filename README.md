👨‍💻 Formerly managed servers and developed for [TF15/2BNB](https://discord.gg/FA7EJkq2zU) milsim group. Still enjoy dabbling in development 😊 Created [Workshop Monitor](https://github.com/UrekD/Steam-Workshop-Monitor) to streamline server updates; there might even be an instance running on my homelab! Nowadays, I'm primarily focused on professional endeavors and ensuring my personal infrastructure stays shipshape. 💼💻

- Server management, homelab, and smaller scale deployments 💻🔧
- Exploring Docker 🐳
- Diving deeper into Python 🐍
- CS 2 🎮🎯 and Squad 🎮👨‍✈️
- Contributing to open source projects 🛠️
